# $N^2 - 1$ Sliding Puzzle Solver

The generalization of the classical fifteen puzzle (15-puzzle) or eigth sliding puzzle (8-puzzle). This repository implements an $N^2 - 1$ puzzle interface as well as a solver based on the paper [A Real-Time Algorithm for the $(N^2 âˆ’ 1)-Puzzle$](https://ianparberry.com/pubs/saml.pdf).

The algorithm in simple terms, moves each row and column tiles 1 by 1 to their target locations, and does this iteratively, until we end up with a 3x3 grid. At this point we apply A* (A-star) algorithm and solve the rest of the puzzle.


To run:

1. Run `poetry install`
2. `poetry run python main.py --n 5`

Try with different values for `n`.


I just did this for fun ðŸ˜Š
